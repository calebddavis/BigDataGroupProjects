BEFORE INSTALLING HADOOP WITH THIS SCRIPT, YOU
MUST HAVE CREATED A HADOOP USER IN THE SUDO GROUP
AND SETUP SSH.

HERE IS SOMETHING TO GET YOU STARTED.

#!/bin/bash
# hadoop install script

# create group for hadoop user
sudo addgroup hadoop

# create hadoop user
sudo adduser --ingroup hadoop hadoop

# allow hadoop to sudo
sudo adduser hadoop sudo

# switch user (su) to hadoop user
su hadoop

# generate an ssh key for hadoop user
ssh-keygen

# copy the ssh id to localhost and test
ssh-copy-id localhost
ssh localhost
